# Global-Sales-Performance-analysis

## Overview

This project features a **Global Sales Performance Dashboard** designed to track key sales metrics across multiple countries, product categories, and accounts. The dashboard provides insights into Year-to-Date (YTD) sales, Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) comparisons, sales volume, and Gross Profit Percentage (GP%). The primary objective is to give business stakeholders a data-driven tool to monitor and analyze global sales performance.

## Objectives

- **Track YTD Sales Growth**: Monitor total sales for the current year and compare them to the previous year.
- **Analyze Sales Quantity**: Evaluate sales volumes across regions and product types to identify trends.
- **Evaluate Profitability (GP%)**: Measure gross profit margins across different accounts to assess financial health.
- **Identify Top-Performing Countries**: Provide insights into the best and worst-performing countries by YTD sales and growth rate.

## Dashboard Features

1. **YTD Sales vs PYTD Sales (Quantity, Sales, Profit)**:
    - Total YTD sales for 2023: **13.00M** vs PYTD sales: **13.5M**.
    - GP%: **0.40** highlighting overall profitability.
   
2. **Sales by Country (Treemap)**:
    - A treemap visualizing YTD sales by country, with **China, the Philippines, Brazil**, and **Portugal** being the top contributors.

3. **YTD vs PYTD by Month (Bar Chart)**:
    - A monthly comparison that shows increases or decreases in sales volume for each month, helping to identify trends.

4. **Sales by Quarter, Month, and Product Type (Stacked Bar Chart)**:
    - A breakdown of sales by product type: **Indoor, Outdoor, Landscape**, and others across different months and quarters.

5. **Sales and GP% by Account (Scatter Plot)**:
    - A scatter plot comparing YTD sales and GP% across different accounts, enabling identification of profitable and underperforming accounts.

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Data Sources
- The data comes from global sales transactions in 2023, with comparisons to the same period in 2022.

### Methodology

1. **Sales and Profit Calculation**:
   - YTD Sales are cumulative sales from January to the current date in 2023.
   - PYTD Sales are cumulative sales from the same period in 2022.
   - **GP% (Gross Profit Percentage)** is calculated using the formula:
      \[
      GP\% = \left(\frac{\text{Sales} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Sales}}\right) \times 100
      \]

2. **Monthly Comparison**:
   - Sales data is aggregated by month and compared to the previous year's performance to identify growth or decline trends.

3. **Treemap**:
   - Sales contribution by country is visualized, with larger boxes representing higher YTD sales volumes.

4. **Scatter Plot**:
   - The X-axis represents sales volume (YTD Sales), and the Y-axis represents GP%, showing which accounts are driving the most profitability.

## Insights

1. **Top Countries by Sales**:
   - **China** leads in YTD sales, followed by **the Philippines** and **Brazil**.

2. **Monthly Sales Trends**:
   - Sales grew consistently from January to July, with a notable decline in the latter half of the year, possibly due to external factors such as seasonality.

3. **Product Category Performance**:
   - **Indoor** and **Landscape** product types dominate in terms of sales performance, especially during the third quarter.

4. **Profitability Insights**:
   - Accounts with the highest sales volume don't always have the highest GP%. This reveals opportunities to focus on profitability improvements for certain accounts.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Predictive Analytics**: Implement machine learning models to forecast future sales trends.
2. **Regional Focus**: Develop region-specific dashboards for more granular insights.
3. **Product Line Expansion**: Further breakdown of product performance within the indoor, outdoor, and landscape categories.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers by purchase behavior or demographics to improve sales strategies.

## Conclusion

The **Global Sales Performance Dashboard** provides actionable insights into sales performance across regions, product types, and accounts. It allows stakeholders to monitor both top-line growth and profitability, helping drive strategic decisions. The analysis highlights key regions and accounts contributing to overall performance, as well as opportunities for improvement in profitability and market expansion.
